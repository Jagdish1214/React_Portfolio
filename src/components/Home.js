            <strong>My name is Jagdish Shinde</strong>. I have completed my
            Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Mit ACSC, Alandi. I am a
            Fresher and currently pursuing my Masters in Full Stack Java
            Development at IT Vedant. I have hands-on knowledge of programming
            languages like Java, Python, C Programming, frontend technologies like
            HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and for databases I have hands-on knowledge in
            PostgreSQL.  
            <br /><br />
            I also made a small project called <strong>Laundry Management System</strong>,
            which helped me understand how websites are built.  
            <br /><br />
            One of my strengths is that I'm a quick learner, detail-oriented, and
            always try to complete my work on time. I also work well in team
            environments and enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common
            goals.  
            <br /><br />
            In the future, I want to work as a Full Stack Developer in a reputed
            organization where I can gain knowledge and build my career in the IT
            industry.  
            <br /><br />
            That's all about me. Thank you!!!
